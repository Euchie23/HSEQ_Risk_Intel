# 🦺 HSE Risk Intelligence — Project Portfolio

## 🌍 Real-World Value

The **HSE Risk Intelligence** system provides a comprehensive safety, hazard, and operational monitoring platform for industrial worksites.  
It integrates **attendance, tasks, hazards, incidents, observations, toolbox meetings, and corrective actions** into a centralized database, enabling:  

- Real-time operational oversight and structured daily KPI reporting  
- Task, phase, and zone-level hazard trend analysis  
- Incident root-cause analysis and intervention lifecycle tracking  
- Planning-versus-execution validation through toolbox-to-task linkage  
- Evidence-based decision-making for site management and executives  
- Scalable architecture supporting multi-site and longitudinal safety insights  
- Future AI-assisted querying and predictive safety analytics   

This project demonstrates **senior-level consultancy competencies** in database design, HSE risk management, and operational analytics.

## 🔐 Data Ethics, Governance & Portfolio Use

This project is built from field-derived HSE observations and operational reporting authored by the developer during routine site oversight.  
It is **not** exported from any proprietary company system or database.

All tasks, hazards, observations, incidents, toolbox topics, and operational records originate from daily HSE reports and PPE verification sheets personally prepared as part of on-site responsibilities.

For portfolio and GitHub publication, the following governance rules are applied:

- Worker names are anonymized in the `PERSON` table  
- Site and company identifiers are generalized in the `SITE` and `ZONE` tables  
- PTW, JSA, and certification numbers are anonymized  
- Company-specific risk matrices, severity scales, and probability classifications are abstracted into generic lookup tables  
- Observations and toolbox discussions reflect operational reality without exposing proprietary frameworks  
- No proprietary documents, templates, or internal systems are reproduced  

The dataset therefore represents a **structured abstraction of real operational patterns** while fully preserving confidentiality.

This demonstrates how real-world HSE intelligence can be translated into a governed, relational database suitable for analytics, dashboards, and future AI-assisted querying — while adhering to professional data ethics and privacy standards.

**Conceptual Flow (enhanced):**

- The ERD illustrates how tasks serve as operational anchors within the **Site → Zone → Phase → Task hierarchy**, while observations may also exist independently to capture broader site risks.
- Hazards may originate from **task exposure, observational findings, or pre-task toolbox discussions**.
- Hazard Controls are implemented and evaluated via the **Control Effectiveness Scale**.
- Residual risk is calculated for both hazards and controls to quantify remaining risk after mitigation.
- Corrective Actions are created:
  - Directly from observations
  - From hazard controls that fail effectiveness evaluation
  - Through incident → intervention pathways
- The loop continues until hazard is mitigated, corrective action is closed, and residual risk is reduced.
- Weather and environmental factors provide contextual exposure analysis.
- Legal-grade traceability of PTW and JSA documentation through source classification (Contractor vs Client), enabling audit readiness, compliance validation and dispute resolution support
